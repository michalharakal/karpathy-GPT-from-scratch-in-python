# GTP from scratch in python 

This is a fork based on project from [Andrej Karpathy, Neural Networks: Zero To Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) 

See details on the original source.

The main goal of this fork is to study and understand basic building block, so existing code can be modularized and rebuild from scratch again in a different programming language.
